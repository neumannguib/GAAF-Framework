GAAF : Genome Assembly Analysis Framework

GAAF is an analysis framework, in the context of Genome Assembly domain, which aims to facilitate the process of post analysis. It emerged from the issue related to the quality interpretation of assembled genome data.

INSTALLATION:

You do not need to install the framework, in order to use its code. But, you do need to provide its dependencies :
	
python >=2.7
	
zlib and boost

However, we instantiate the framework in a study case, where you can see how it works, and how to install and use third-party tools (./install_extensions.sh)
