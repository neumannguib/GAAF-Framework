MIRA warncode: CONCOV_SUSPICIOUS_DISTRIBUTION
Title: Suspicious distribution of contig coverages

- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  large contigs) have an average coverage less than 75% of the average coverage
  of all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage more than 125% of the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage 25% above or below the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
Summary: found 3 indicator(s) for coverage problem(s).

If the DNA you are assembling is bacterial, this could indicate that you sampled
and sequenced DNA from exponential or late exponential phase of a bacterial
population. This leads to a coverage bias toward the origin of replication,
hence false positive detection of repeats, hence an assembly which is more
fragmented than it could be or may have misassemblies in regions located toward
the opposite of the origin of replication.
Only available countermeasure: for your next sequencing project, do not sample
in exponential phase but sample in stationary phase (if possible).

MIRA warncode: CONCOV_SUSPICIOUS_DISTRIBUTION
Title: Suspicious distribution of contig coverages

- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  large contigs) have an average coverage less than 75% of the average coverage
  of all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage more than 125% of the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage 25% above or below the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
Summary: found 3 indicator(s) for coverage problem(s).

If the DNA you are assembling is bacterial, this could indicate that you sampled
and sequenced DNA from exponential or late exponential phase of a bacterial
population. This leads to a coverage bias toward the origin of replication,
hence false positive detection of repeats, hence an assembly which is more
fragmented than it could be or may have misassemblies in regions located toward
the opposite of the origin of replication.
Only available countermeasure: for your next sequencing project, do not sample
in exponential phase but sample in stationary phase (if possible).

-------- CRITICAL warning --------

MIRA warncode: CONCOV_SUSPICIOUS_DISTRIBUTION
Title: Suspicious distribution of contig coverages

- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  large contigs) have an average coverage less than 75% of the average coverage
  of all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage more than 125% of the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage 25% above or below the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
Summary: found 3 indicator(s) for coverage problem(s).

If the DNA you are assembling is bacterial, this could indicate that you sampled
and sequenced DNA from exponential or late exponential phase of a bacterial
population. This leads to a coverage bias toward the origin of replication,
hence false positive detection of repeats, hence an assembly which is more
fragmented than it could be or may have misassemblies in regions located toward
the opposite of the origin of replication.
Only available countermeasure: for your next sequencing project, do not sample
in exponential phase but sample in stationary phase (if possible).

-------- CRITICAL warning --------

MIRA warncode: CONCOV_SUSPICIOUS_DISTRIBUTION
Title: Suspicious distribution of contig coverages

- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  large contigs) have an average coverage less than 75% of the average coverage
  of all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage more than 125% of the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
- 0 contig(s) with a total of 0 bases (= -nan% of bases in all non-repetitive
  contigs) have an average coverage 25% above or below the average coverage of
  all non-repetitive large contigs.
Summary: found 3 indicator(s) for coverage problem(s).

If the DNA you are assembling is bacterial, this could indicate that you sampled
and sequenced DNA from exponential or late exponential phase of a bacterial
population. This leads to a coverage bias toward the origin of replication,
hence false positive detection of repeats, hence an assembly which is more
fragmented than it could be or may have misassemblies in regions located toward
the opposite of the origin of replication.
Only available countermeasure: for your next sequencing project, do not sample
in exponential phase but sample in stationary phase (if possible).
